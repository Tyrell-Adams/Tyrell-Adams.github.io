subtitle: Proactive Defense System
project_title: "Proactive Defense System for Unforeseen Adversarial Attacks"

problem: |
 The problem with cyber defence systems is that they are reactive against known attacks, which can be an issue when dealing with constantly evolving threats.

  This project aims to develop a meta-learning-based proactive defense system to counter unforeseen attacks and threats.
approach: |
  The project follows a three-phase pipeline:

  - Develop meta-learning-based proactive defence systems to defend against unforeseen threats and attacks
  - Upload the codes used for the proactive defence system to IoT devices
  - Conduct many tests and evaluations to measure and document the performance against unforeseen attacks in real time
  
  Open-source tools such as Python and C++ will be used for the implementation of meta-testing

outcome: |
  By the end of the program, each participant will be equipped with skills in communication, networking, cybersecurity, and machine learning tailored to cybersecurity detection on IoT devices. In addition to all of that, participants will have large improvements when it comes to basic software programming skills.
