  bio: |
    I’m currently a junior studying Cybersecurity Intelligence Management at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. I expect to graduate in 2027.

    My work explores the development of meta-learning-based proactive defence systems in order to predict unforeseen adversarial attacks.

    When I’m not working on research, I enjoy working out, playing basketball, gaming during my free time, and I like to partake in community service.
