what_i_learned: |
  Today the first thing I learned about was computer vision which is teaching computers how to understand and the world like humans.Then we broke out into the Python classes and I learned about Casting, Variables, and the input and output cycle. Casting is data conversion, variables are named values, and the input/output cycle is how code is inserted by the user and processed by the system.
blockers: |
  There were no blockers!
  
reflection: |
  Today was smooth and very informal! I enjoyed the computer vision presentation because it was very ineractive and fun. The escape room was a great brain break and it also helped improve communication within my group as well. The python class gave me more of a refresher as well.
