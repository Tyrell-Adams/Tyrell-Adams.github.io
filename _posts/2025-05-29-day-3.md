what_i_learned: |
  Today the first thing I learned about was computer vision which is teaching computers how to understand and the world like humans.We went over things like object tracking which is locating and tracking objects across succcessive frame and image segmentation which is the process of dividing images into regions. Then we broke out into the Python classes and I learned about Casting, Variables, and the input and output cycle. Casting is data conversion, variables are named values, and the input/output cycle is how code is inserted by the user and processed by the system.

  There were no blockers!
  
reflection: |
  Today was smooth and very informal! I enjoyed the computer vision presentation because it was very ineractive and fun. The escape room was a great brain break and it also helped improve communication within my group as well. The python class gave me more of a refresher on alot of needed key concepts as well.
