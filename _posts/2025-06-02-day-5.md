what_i_learned: |
 Today my group went over the key concepts of cybersecurity like confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, and non-repudiation. We also pointed out the key differences in machine learning and ai in regards of the ai just being the system and the machine learning is the processing thats within the system.

blockers: |
  Seeing some of the equations that went along with the process of building a proactive defense system for unforeseen adversarial attacks was challenging to understand, besides that there were no other blockers.

reflection: |
 Learning the information about cybersecurity was more of a refresher. But when we talked more about systems, machine learning, and ai, it was a very needed eye opener when it came to a variety of concepts.
