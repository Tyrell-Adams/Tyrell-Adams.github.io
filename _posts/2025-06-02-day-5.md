what_i_learned: |
 Today my group went over the key concepts of cybersecurity like confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, and non-repudiation. We also pointed out the key differences in machine learning and ai in regards of the ai just being the system and the machine learning is the processing thats within the system. Lastly, the article that my group is going over is telling me that the main goal is to train a meta-policy that adapts to new task as well as use past tasks in order to predict unforeseen attacks.

blockers: |
  Seeing some of the equations that went along with the process of building a proactive defense system for unforeseen adversarial attacks was challenging to understand and the methodology for the project is complex as well.

reflection: |
 Learning the information about cybersecurity was more of a refresher. But when we talked more about systems, machine learning, and ai, it was a very needed eye opener when it came to a variety of concepts. To sum up the project, the objective is very understandable but the work within the project looks complext and I may need some time in order to understand it.
