what_i_learned: |
  Today we went over more articles and examples of different types of code that related with our final project. The first presentation/ article  went over a token frequency histogram and it taught me how to alter and edit that histogram along with the data given with it. In the second article/ presentation, we went over a weather dataset and a wine dataset. I learned how to make those datasets into models and then add predictions and accuracy inputs into the code. I learned more about features and labels, as well as X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test.

  Today we went over a little bit of out-of-date code so I had a little trouble finding the updated alternatives for the out-of-date code.

reflection: |
  Today was mostly going over and following along presentations in order to understand how certain code works. That process went really well even with the errors I got when following along. I was able to fix the errors without frustration and my group also helped each other out when it came to that as well. I'm understanding things more and more as we go on and I can see my improvement when it comes to coding.
