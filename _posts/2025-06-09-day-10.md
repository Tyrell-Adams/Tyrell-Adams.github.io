what_i_learned: |
  Today we went over more articles and examples of different types of code that related with our final project. The first presentation/ article  went over a token frequency histogram and it taught me how to alter and edit that histogram along with the data given with it. In the second article/ presentation, we went over a weather dataset and a wine dataset. I learned how to make those datasets into models and then add predictions and accuracy outputs into the code. I learned more about features and labels, as well as X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test.

  There was no blockers during this session!

reflection: |
  Today wasvery engaging experience and it was very hands on which helped me understand the key concepts of Git and Github. Very easy to understand! Before that, there was the placement test which was also a straightfoward process which placed us into our respective python classes. Learning about my group group members was smooth and informal especially because everyone was talking and being interactive.
