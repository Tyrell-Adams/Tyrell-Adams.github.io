what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about my peers doing the connection bingo and I also conversed with my group and learned a little about them personlly. I learned most of the core concepts about git and github. I learned about the repository which contains project files and hisory of changes and I learned concepts like push, pull, clone, which is used when creating a project.

blockers: |
  There was no blockers during this session!

reflection: |
  It was an very engaging experience and it was very hands on which helped me understand the key concepts. Very easy to understand! Before that, there was the placement test which was also a straightfoward process. Learning about my group was also very smooth and informal as well.
