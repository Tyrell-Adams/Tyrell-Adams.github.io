what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about my peers doing the connection bingo and I also conversed with my group and learned a little about them personally. I learned most of the core concepts about git and github. When it comes to git and github, I learned how to create and edit a website. I learned about the repository which contains project files and hisory of changes and I learned concepts like push, pull, clone, which is used when creating a project.

blockers: |
  There was no blockers during this session!

reflection: |
  Today wasvery engaging experience and it was very hands on which helped me understand the key concepts of Git and Github. Very easy to understand! Before that, there was the placement test which was also a straightfoward process which placed us into our respective python classes. Learning about my group group members was smooth and informal especially because everyone was talking and being interactive.
