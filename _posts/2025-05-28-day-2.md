what_i_learned: |
  I learned more about my project and what is contains as well as how it relates to cybersecurity. This information was given by the mentor for my project and I also learned a little about every other mentor on top of that. After that I got a refresher on Python when it comes to data types and functions.

 

blockers: |
  There was no blockers!

reflection: |
  Speaking with the faculty lead, Cliston Cole, he clearly explained the project and what's expected. He also explained what we needed to do before the first in person day. The Python101 course with very easy to understand and it was also very interactive on top of that. Lastly, the fun activity that we called headbands, after everything was very fun and interactive as well.
