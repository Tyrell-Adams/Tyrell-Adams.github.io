what_i_learned: |
  Today we what over machine learning and a little about its history and purpose. We went over key terms like unsupervised machine learning which is learning data that doesn't contain labels and supervised which is machine learning that comes with labels. Fraud would be and example of unsupervised and facial detection and things of that nature is supervised. Then we transitioned to another ML project which went over natural language processing (NLP). Things like tokenization, getting and exploring data, data processing, and clustering were some of the things I learned from this ML project.
blockers: |
  I had trouble with some debugging while going through the ML project. But overall, the process was still great!
reflection: |
  Expanding my knowledge on machine learning was very helpful, especially when it comes to understanding the main goal of my groups project. During this ML project, I took my time going over each line of code so I could fully grasp the concept and I plan to go back to all the codes we did and do that as well. I still have issues with the errors but ive learned that is normal and its something that you have to get used to when coding. Overall, Ive been sucessfully expanding my knowledge on machine learning and I plan to continue to grow!
