  Today we went into more detail about meta-adv and about the overal process of how to train an AI on ow to handle new,       unforeseen attacks. We are basically teaching AI to defend itself by showing it examples of adversarial attacks or "Sneaky tricks" that causes AI to make mistakes. The Mmodel-agnostic meta-learning finds the best starting point to ensure the model can adapt fast to new problems with little to no training. The examples of adversarial attacks, come from images from CIFAR-10 and Tiny-ImageNet which are collections of images within a dataset that helps train and test ai.
