what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about the machine learning process when using MAML (meta agnostic meta learning) which is a meta learning algorithm that finds optimal parameters for a ML model that maximizes performance across a variety of tasks and also there is Meta-adv, which is the proposed novel framework that follows the structure of MAML. These will improve machine learning model's ability to withstand adversarial attacks(robustness). I also learned about an example of this process that involves training for image detection. Using attacked images, which are images that are slighlty altered to bypass a system, you split 2/3 of the images into a training subset which trains the model and then the rest of the images are moved into the test subset in order to test if the model can detect attackers that it's never seen before.
  
blockers: |
  The mathematical formalization of the process was my only blocker because its a little confusing and it's also alot of information to take in at one time when it comes to the different symbols and meanings behind those symbols.
  
reflection: |
  In general, the concept of this machine learning process using MAML was understandable, but once I got into the details it became more complex and dificult. But im staring to understand things more and more, like how the system is trained to be specific.Overall the process of learning the base objective is going very smooth. If I continue to go over things, ill have no doubt that it will come to me eventually.
