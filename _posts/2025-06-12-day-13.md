what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how navigate and edit my report on Overleaf during the the enrichment block this morning. After the enrichment block we went went back into our labs and I continued to replicate an Meta-adv model and I leanred how to manipulate the code so it can give smaller and or larger amounts of results. Along side that, since we are on laptops, I had to learn how to enforce CPU only training by putting in the input of "device = torch.device("cpu")." In general I learned how to manipulate certain code in order to get an outcome I wanted.

  There were no blockers today!
reflection: |
  Today was very fun, engaging, and informative within the enrichment block and the lab time. Playing the games during the enrichment blocks was very refreshing as well and it was a great bonding experience. When it comes to Overleaf, I thought it was going to be a little more complex but it ended being very simple and easy to understand. My coding experience today was great! I understood the things I had trouble with and I also learned new concepts that were needed.
