what_i_learned: |
  Today when I was developing the model that is going to be used for the project, I had to learn a variety of new coding concepts. I learned the difference between inner and outer loop with inner loop being used for fast task-specific adaptation and outer loop being used for Meta optimizer updates. I learned some pytorch skills like the custom adversarial attack function which is a function that generates adversarial examples that uses projected gradient descent. With that I had to learn how to manipulate gradients which is still something I need to go over.
blockers: |
  I had lots of trouble with the run time for my code.
reflection: |
  Today I was mainly training the machine learning model that I created and I was also altering the code when needed. Learning how to alter the code constanly to shape the result that I wanted was challenging. My group also met with the faculty mentor and we gave him a reflection of our progress and we talked about our goals for next week. In order to be sucessful, I need to fully go through my code to understand exactly what im doing and how I need to improve my code for an better output.
