what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned more about what the project entails and we went over an example of the coding processes that comes with it. Now I know that theres going to be lots of errors when doing this project.I saw the meta-training coding process and the coding process for testing. Then as colab was analyzing and processing the code, I learn what epoch and how it involved the tranference of data.
blockers: |
  When trying to get an example of the process within colab, I was getting constant errors which hindered the process.
reflection: |
  I went over a visual representation of the code which gave me more insight on what everything entails. But I still need to go over the lines of code because its going over things I haven't seen before. I understand the concept of the project, now I need to understand the how within code. Overall, if I spend a day or so going line by line and using my resourses to understand what the main coding algorthms mean, I feel like I should be ready to progress.
