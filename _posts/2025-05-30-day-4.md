what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about conditions which is something that is either True or False in coding, Keywords which is a specail word in programming that can't be overwritten, if else and if statements for decision-making under certain conditions and these fall under the boolean data type. Relational and logical operators fall under this and they are ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=, as well as the "and", "or", and "not" statement. Lastly we learned about Generative AI which is artifical intelligence that can create and gnerate new content like images, audio, video, and text.

  There were no blockers!
  
reflection: |
  Starting the day, we did a survey which was very simple and smooth. The python lesson after that was very informal and I clearly understood everything that was being taught. Shortly after the python lesson, there was a very informal powerpoint on generative AI with hands-on activites which was fun and interesting. Finally to end the day, we went over a variety of pictures and tried to figue out if they were AI or real which I really enjoyed.
