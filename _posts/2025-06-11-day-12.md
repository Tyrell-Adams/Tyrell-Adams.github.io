what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about support vector machine(SVM) which is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and in the powerpoint given, it said something along the lines of the SVM was used to find the optimal hyperplane that splits up observations. SVM ultimately leads to outliars which is data that is very different or data that is misplaced compared to the other data along side it. Data also has different ways to group depending on what your goal is, some data requires a large grouping system and some need smaller and more precise grouping. Lastly I learned how large the data sample for the project was compared to the examples that we have been going over.

  The only thing I had trouble with was replicating the meta-adv code in the example given to my group.
reflection: |
  We were given the fourth example assignment in which we trained a small model in order for it to give accurate predictions. When I first finished the code, the prediction it gave me was very bad, I ended up getting a 22.8% accuracy. Then I went through the code and made a large amount of changes in order to increase that number to 92.2%. Overall, today was a very sucessful day when it came to understanding certain content and understanding the code.
