what_i_learned: |
  Today I continued to go over coding models that we did yesterday and I went over them line by line for a deeper  understanding. For an example, I learned about code used for conversion which is le.fit_transform which convert words into numbers and store it into a variable. I also learned about model.fit() which trains a model usinf data of your choice.
