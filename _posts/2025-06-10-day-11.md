what_i_learned: |
  Today I continued to go over coding models that we did yesterday and I went over them line by line for a deeper  understanding. For an example, I learned about code used for conversion which is le.fit_transform which convert words into numbers and stores it into a variable. I also learned about model.fit() which trains a model using data of your choice. The data from these said predictions can also be completely wrong on a larger scale which kinda caught me by suprise when I was going over the models.

  There were no blockers today!
reflection: |
  Today was primarily note taking and going over the notes to get a basic understanding of certain lines of code. I finished what I needed to get through and I also can say that have a basic understanding of the code that is being portrayed. With the 2nd assignment, I found it very interesting that you have to filter out so much data when you are trying to hyperfixate on a small group of data, I definitely underestimated the amount. Also in the third assignment, the predictions were wrong with it saying yes to going outside to play in rainy or bad weather and no to sunny or good weather which was something I didn't catch until I was told to look through things carefully.
